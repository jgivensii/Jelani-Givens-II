## 🌌 About Me
I’m a physicist and analytical problem solver who builds tools, models, and systems that merge scientific thinking with modern software development. My background spans physics, data analysis, automation, and algorithmic design — and I’m driven by curiosity, creativity, and the desire to understand complex systems.

I’m currently working toward a career in **quantitative research** or **theoretical physics**, where I can apply mathematical modeling, computational methods, and data‑driven reasoning to real‑world problems.
